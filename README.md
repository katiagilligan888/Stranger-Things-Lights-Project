# Stranger-Things-Lights-Project
Create a web-connected LED display to show messages and images using an ESP32, addressable LED strip, Arduino IDE, and FastLED library for effects inspired by the hit Netflix series Stranger Things. Customize the message board to your liking by adjusting the number of LEDs, animation speeds, and more for creative projects or decorations.
